# Myanmar Home Discovery — Product Blueprint

## 1. Product vision

Build the most trusted and human way to find a home in Myanmar. The product is not a classified-listing directory; it is a guided discovery experience that helps people move from “I might need a home” to “I feel confident viewing this one.”

### Product promise

**Real homes, clear information, direct conversations.**

### Strategic principles

1. **Trust before inventory.** Verification, freshness, owner identity, transparent fees, and report controls are visible before users make contact.
2. **A home search, not a form.** Start with familiar locations and intent, then progressively reveal filters in everyday language.
3. **Myanmar-first communication.** English and Myanmar typography, phone-first contact, low-bandwidth images, familiar MMK price expressions, and address landmarks.
4. **Mobile is the primary product.** Thumb-friendly controls, short paths, persistent save/contact actions, and strong performance on mid-range devices.
5. **Reduce fear and effort.** Explain unfamiliar terms, show what happens next, and never force an account before the user has found value.
6. **Quality over volume.** Fresh, complete, verified homes rank above duplicated or low-quality supply.

### North-star outcome

**Qualified viewing requests per active home seeker.** This measures successful discovery and trust—not clicks or raw listing volume.

### Supporting success metrics

- Search-to-detail-view rate
- Detail-to-contact rate
- Contact-to-viewing-confirmed rate
- Verified listing share
- Duplicate/stale listing rate
- Saved-home return rate within 7 days
- Median owner response time

## Homepage product direction

The homepage begins with a single emotional promise and a cinematic, credible home—not a wall of listings. Search is presented as four plain-language decisions. Popular townships work as familiar shortcuts. Property cards prioritize image, monthly/total price, essential facts, verification, and freshness. The trust section explains the verification system before asking users to believe it. The AI assistant is framed as a guided conversation, not magic, and always explains why homes are recommended.

### Responsive behavior

- **Desktop:** restrained top navigation, immersive split hero, horizontal property collections, explanatory trust and assistant panels.
- **Mobile:** compact brand/search header, horizontal township chips and cards, shortened copy, sticky bottom navigation, 44px minimum touch targets.
- **Low bandwidth:** first image loads first; additional imagery is lazy; content and verification never depend on images.
